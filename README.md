## Project Description
In this project, we conduct and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an insurance charges dataset to discover and understand the relationship between insurance charges and different health and demographic factors (age, sex, region, BMI, smoker, number of children). The data set is from the [GitHub repository of Machine Learning with R datasets](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv).

## Data analysis insights

### Univariate analysis
In this section, we used tables and interactive (ggplotly) charts to explore the distribution of each features from the data set in order to understand the data sample we are working with.

We derived the following insights from this sections:
* The percentage of females in the data is 49% and the percentage of males is 51%, which indicates that the data is balanced in terms of sex.
* The majority of individuals in the dataset have less than 2 children (85.05%). Also, 42.9% of individuals donâ€™t have any children while only 3.21% have more than 3 children.
* The majority of individuals in the data are non smokers (79.52%).
* Individuals in the data sample are distributed almost evenly among the four regions, with southeast being the most common region in the data (27.2%).
* Individuals aged less than 20 years old make only 10.24% of the data, as the majority is aged over 40 years old (47.61%).
* We find that 31.39% of individuals in the data have charges over the average, which means that these individuals have some extreme charges values that pulled the average.
* The distribution of BMI looks symmetrical and centered around 30.
